# Activities

A good thing that we can extract from society is the culture and arts.  
It's actually pretty easy to access its content and learn a lot, discover things for free.

- Your first option is to aim for **free museums** or **free expositions**. It's not always free unfortunately, but at specific days or age range you can access free entry.  
Then, all the knowledge is yours either it's a museum a specific exposition or an art gallery.

- You can also in the major cities join some **free tours**. Someone will provide you with a guided-tour through the city and show you some touristic places (or hopefully not too touristic) and teach you some history about this place.

> [!WARNING]
> These "free tours" are often not free but based on suggested donations. Also they are often partners of shops in the cities so don't be surprised if the tour include a visit to some specific shops. Choose your "free tour" carrefuly.

- **Botanical gardens** are an awesome way to discover some local flowers, trees, plants or just enjoy a refreshing walk a bit disconneted from the city. You'll also find some informative board to learn more about the park or the town.
